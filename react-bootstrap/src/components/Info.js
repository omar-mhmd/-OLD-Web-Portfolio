    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I hope that everything is good,
      I don't use a CV because I never had the need to have one, the word of mouth was sufficient for me.
      Below is a small bio about myself:
      **
      Born in 1993 at Abidjan, capital of the Ivory Coast, Ivan Debs leaves Africa and moves to Lebanon to finish his studies.
      The passionate painter had to continue inevitably with this perspective, more precisely in the illustration field.
      Ivan spends most of his time drawing and playing music, that bonds completely with his work.
      A calm character combined with discretion, commitment and determination, finds its way to express itself through painting, seeking discovery and perfection.</p>
